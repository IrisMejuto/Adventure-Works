In this project, carried out with Power BI, I examined the evolution of Adventure Works sales from 2015 to 2017 in countries such as: United States, Canada, France, Germany, Australia and United Kingdom.

For this I have used the Power BI tool, both for cleaning, modeling, exploring and visualizing the data. included.

My focus has been on deciphering sales trends across continents, identifying customer preferences and behaviours, and evaluating products with the highest return rates.

The Dataset that I have used for this project is taken from 👉🏼🗃️ [AdventureWorksDataSet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms)

The data modeling stage involved creating a relational data model that reflects the relationships between customers, sales, products, returns, and territories.

## ⚒️ Visualizations and Functions Used:
* I created advanced DAX measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, profitability, and comparisons against targets.
* I implemented drill-down functionality to reveal details by product category, allowing for deeper understanding of each segment.
* I applied hierarchies to territory fields to facilitate analysis by geographic location.
* I used conditional formatting to enhance the visual interpretation of data and highlight areas of interest.
* I designed KPI cards that reflect the company's real-time achievement of objectives.
