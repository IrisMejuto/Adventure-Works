# Adventure-Works


 ## ⭐ Key questions the project answers:

* ✅ What are the top and bottom-selling cycling products in the past year?
* ✅ How are sales of cycling products distributed across regions, and which regions are the most profitable?
* ✅ What has been the monthly sales trend for cycling products over the past year? Are there seasonal patterns?
* ✅ How does marketing expenditure correlate with sales revenue from cycling products?
* ✅ How does the sales performance of cycling products compare to the same period last year?
* ✅ Which cycling product categories are exceeding or falling short of sales targets?
* ✅ How do different sales channels affect the overall performance of cycling products?
* ✅ What impact do returns of cycling products have on profitability?
